# manager — business orchestration (the hub)

## Purpose
`SkillManager` is **the** orchestration layer. Every CLI command, TUI action, and MCP tool goes through it. Owns an `AppPaths` and a `Database`, coordinates `scanner`/`linker`/`installer`/`market` to execute operations. If unsure where an operation lives, start here.

## Public API (≈30 methods — pick the relevant family)

**Construction**: `new()` / `with_base(base)` / `paths()` / `db()`

**Resource lifecycle**:
- `scan()` — delegate to scanner.
- `register_local_skill(name)` — add a skill that's already under `skills/` to the DB.
- `enable_resource(id, target, group?)` / `disable_resource(...)` — for skill: create/remove symlink; for MCP: edit target's config file.
- `uninstall(id)` — remove files, symlinks across all targets, and DB row.
- `list_resources(kind?, target?)` — unified listing (Skills from DB + MCPs by reading each CLI's config live via `mcp_discovery`).
- `find_resource_id(name)` / `find_group_id(query)` — fuzzy lookup.
- `record_usage(name)` / `usage_stats()` — usage tracking (DB-backed).

**Groups**:
- `create_group(id, group)` / `list_groups()` / `rename_group` / `update_group` / `get_group_members(id)` / `enable_group` / `disable_group`.

**Install**:
- `install_github_repo(owner, repo, branch, target)` — fetch, classify, register, group.
- `register_and_group_skills(...)` — called after market install.
- `batch_delete(names) -> (count, failed)`.

**Status**: `status(target) -> (enabled_skills, enabled_mcps)`, `resource_count()`, `is_first_launch()`.

## Key invariants
- **MCP enabled state is never in DB.** Re-read every `list_resources` / `status` call from CLI config files (`mcp_discovery::discover_all`). Caching this would go stale.
- **Skill enabled state is never in DB.** It's the filesystem (symlink exists). DB only stores metadata and group membership.
- `enable_resource(group=Some)` also records the resource under the group in DB — keep the `group` param flowing through install paths.
- `disable_rune_self` — refuses to disable runai's own MCP entry across CLIs (guard rail).

## Touch points
- **Upstream**: `cli/mod.rs`, `mcp/tools.rs`, `tui/app.rs` — every high-level feature.
- **Downstream**: `scanner`, `linker`, `installer`, `market`, `db`, `mcp_register`, `mcp_discovery`, `paths`.

## Gotchas
- `list_resources` has non-trivial dedup logic: MCPs can live in multiple CLIs, show once with combined enable-state.
- `with_home` test helper uses `HOME` env var; the whole `tests` module is `#[cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))]` because `dirs 6.x` on Windows uses Win32 API and ignores env vars.
- Enable/disable takes a `target: CliTarget`. Group enable/disable delegates to per-resource with the same target — it is **not** an all-targets operation.
